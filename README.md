# CardDBParser

This simple script uses [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) and jQuery to scrape content from [CardGameDB](http://http://www.cardgamedb.com/) - specifically, the Android: Netrunner cards. It was a small pet project to learn CasperJS and how jQuery interacts with it.

## Using 

Install [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/). Run the script. Have... fun?

## To-do

- Implement handling of exceptions and timeouts
- Skip download of images in case local files already exist
- Improve feedback to the user
